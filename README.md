# Heart-Attack-Disease Predictor
**Description** : Trained with patient datasets based on the data dictionary to predict heart attack

**Preprocessing step** : Train split data,gridsearchcv fine tuner

**ML Model** : Pipeline of 3 models which are logistic regression,decision tree and random forest

**Objectives** : To perform EDA and predict if a person is prone to a heart attack or not
                To achieve model with validation accuracy of more than 70%
                

**Data Dictionary:**

1) age - Age of the patient
2) sex - Sex of the patient
3) cp - Chest pain type ~ 0 = Typical Angina, 1 = Atypical Angina, 2 = Non-anginal Pain, 3 = Asymptomatic
4) trtbps - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
5) chol - Cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
6) fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) ~ 1 = True, 0 = False
7) restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results ~ 0 = Normal, 1 = ST-T wave normality, 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy
8) thalachh - Maximum heart rate achieved
9) oldpeak - Previous peak
10) slp - Slope
11) caa - Number of major vessels
12) thall - Thalium Stress Test result ~ (0,3)
13) exng - Exercise induced angina ~ 1 = Yes, 0 = No
14) output - Target variable

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1) Data Loading
2) Data Inspection
3) Data Cleaning
4) Features Selection
5) Pre-Processing


**Discussion** :

 ðŸŸ There are no NaN values in the data
 
 ðŸŸ There are certain outliers in all the continuous features from the boxplot graph
 
 ðŸŸ Duplicated data only 1 and drop method use to remove it
 
 ðŸŸ Train split test is used to train and split the xtrain,xtest,ytrain,ytest
 
 ðŸŸ For features selection, used logistic and cramers v, to select the highest accuracy respective to the output
 
 ðŸŸ Features select are: age,thalachh,oldpeak and thall
 
 ðŸŸ ML development used logistic classifier, decision tree, and random forest
 
 ðŸŸ MinMaxScaler+RF Classifier has the best accuracy model for training and deployment which is 73%, fine tuner used: 76%
 
 ðŸŸ Streamlit is used for model deployment, to demonstrate prediction of heart attack: Heart.app.py
